# about-me

This project was made for the first week of Code 201 at Code Fellows PDX. The aim was to learn and practice HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript.

Kate was the driver and Stephanie was the navigator for placing existing code into functions.
We wrapped Q1-5 in one function call qOneToFive.
We wrapped Q6 in one function called qSix.
We wrapped Q7 in one function called qSeven.

Left Q&A arrays as global variables.
